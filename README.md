## Installation

-   Clone `git clone https://github.com/dope/lemonade.git`
-   [Download the latest version](https://github.com/dope/lemonade/archive/master.zip)


## Getting Started
Getting started couldn't be easier

### First you need to link the stylesheets
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/lemonade.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/styles.css">
```
lemonade.css is the main grid (which can be easily customised)
styles.css is your base styles on top of your grid

### Structuring your layouts
```
<div class="frame">
	<div class="bit-3">Content here</div>
	<div class="bit-3">Content here</div>
	<div class="bit-3">Content here</div>
</div>
```
Creating a three-column layout (for galleries for example) is really simple, this will scale down to 100% on mobile. Wrap the .bit's in a .frame class to clear the floats.

### Customising your grid
Maybe you want to go old school and create a two-column layout, It's so easy all you need is basic math (along as the .bit- classes equal to 100%, it will be perfect).
```
<div class="frame">
	<div class="bit-75">Content here</div>
	<div class="bit-25">Content here</div>
</div>
```
Creating the css is also simple:
```
.bit-75 {width:75%;}
.bit-25 {width:25%;}
```
